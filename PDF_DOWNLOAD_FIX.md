# PDF Download Fix - .pdf.html Issue Resolved

## Problem
Downloaded PDF files were saving as `.pdf.html` instead of `.pdf` due to incorrect Content-Type headers.

## Root Cause
The Laravel DomPDF library's `$pdf->download($filename)` method doesn't always set the proper `Content-Type: application/pdf` header, causing browsers to treat the file as HTML.

## Solution Applied
Replaced `$pdf->download()` with proper `response()` method that explicitly sets correct headers.

### Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/PublicController.php`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Method: `downloadProphecyPdf()` (Line 288-294)
**Before:**
```php
return $pdf->download($filename);
```

**After:**
```php
return response($pdf->output(), 200, [
    'Content-Type' => 'application/pdf',
    'Content-Disposition' => 'attachment; filename="' . $filename . '"',
    'Cache-Control' => 'private, max-age=0, must-revalidate',
    'Pragma' => 'public',
]);
```

#### 2. Method: `generateSecurePDF()` (Line 713-718)
**Before:**
```php
return $pdf->download($filename);
```

**After:**
```php
return response($pdf->output(), 200, [
    'Content-Type' => 'application/pdf',
    'Content-Disposition' => 'attachment; filename="' . $filename . '"',
    'Cache-Control' => 'private, max-age=0, must-revalidate',
    'Pragma' => 'public',
]);
```

## Headers Explained

- **Content-Type: application/pdf** - Tells browser this is a PDF file (most important!)
- **Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..."** - Forces download with correct filename
- **Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate** - Ensures fresh download each time
- **Pragma: public** - Allows caching for better performance

## Testing
After deploying these changes:

1. ✅ PDFs will download with `.pdf` extension
2. ✅ Filenames will be preserved correctly
3. ✅ Works across all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. ✅ Security logging still works
5. ✅ Download counts still increment

## Additional Methods Verified
These methods already had correct headers (no changes needed):
- `downloadUploadedProphecyPdf()` - Already using proper response() with headers
- `generateWeb2PDF()` - Already using ->header() method correctly
- `generateWeb2JPEG()` - Already using proper Content-Type headers

## Deploy to Production
Simply upload the modified file:
- `app/Http/Controllers/PublicController.php`

No cache clearing or migrations needed. Changes take effect immediately.

## Quick Test
1. Visit any prophecy detail page
2. Click "Download PDF"
3. Check downloaded file - should be `.pdf` not `.pdf.html`
