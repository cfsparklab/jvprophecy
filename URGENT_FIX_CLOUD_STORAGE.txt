🚨 CRITICAL FIX - CLOUD STORAGE ISSUE FOUND!
=====================================================

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Your PDFs are stored on Laravel Cloud:
https://fls-a026b282-8d52-49fc-8351-19bb0eb16be5.laravel.cloud/prophecy_pdfs/

But the directDownloadPdf method was looking for them locally at:
/var/www/html/storage/app/public/

Result: File not found → 404 Error

=====================================================
SOLUTION: UPLOAD THIS FILE
=====================================================

Upload this file to your production server:

  app/Http/Controllers/PublicController.php
  
  → Destination: /var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/

This will overwrite the existing file with the fixed version.

=====================================================
HOW TO UPLOAD
=====================================================

METHOD 1: Via FTP/SFTP (FileZilla, WinSCP)
------------------------------------------
1. Connect to your server
2. Navigate to: /var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/
3. Upload: PublicController.php
4. Overwrite existing file

METHOD 2: Via cPanel File Manager
----------------------------------
1. Login to cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to: /var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/
4. Click Upload
5. Upload PublicController.php
6. Replace existing file

METHOD 3: Via SSH/SCP
---------------------
scp app/Http/Controllers/PublicController.php user@server:/var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/

=====================================================
AFTER UPLOADING
=====================================================

No cache clearing needed this time! Just upload the file.

The route already exists, we just fixed the method logic.

=====================================================
WHAT WAS FIXED
=====================================================

BEFORE (Broken):
----------------
public function directDownloadPdf($id) {
    $pdfPath = storage_path('app/public/' . $pdfFile);  ❌ LOCAL ONLY
    return response()->download($pdfPath, ...);
}

AFTER (Fixed):
--------------
public function directDownloadPdf($id) {
    $pdfService = app(\App\Services\PdfStorageService::class);
    $pdfDisk = env('PDF_STORAGE_DISK', 'public');
    
    if ($pdfDisk === 'r2' || $pdfDisk === 's3') {
        // Get from cloud ✅
        $content = $pdfService->getPdfContent($pdfFile);
        return response($content, 200, [...]);
    } else {
        // Get from local ✅
        $pdfPath = $pdfService->getPdfPath($pdfFile);
        return response()->download($pdfPath, ...);
    }
}

Now supports BOTH local and cloud storage!

=====================================================
TEST AFTER UPLOAD
=====================================================

1. Visit (while logged in):
   https://jvprophecy.vincentselvakumar.org/prophecies/20/direct-download?language=ta

2. Should download: prophecy_20_ta.pdf ✅

3. On mobile: Should download as .pdf (not .htm) ✅

4. From prophecy page: Click "Download PDF" → Works ✅

=====================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENED
=====================================================

Timeline:
1. Initially, PDFs were in local storage
2. Later, you migrated to Laravel Cloud storage
3. Main download method was updated to handle cloud
4. BUT: New directDownloadPdf method was written for local only
5. Result: 404 because it couldn't find files

Now Fixed:
- directDownloadPdf uses PdfStorageService
- Checks PDF_STORAGE_DISK env variable
- Works with both local and cloud storage
- Same logic as the main download method

=====================================================
CHECKLIST
=====================================================

□ Upload PublicController.php to server
□ Overwrite existing file
□ Test: Visit direct-download URL
□ Confirm: Downloads as .pdf
□ Test on mobile: Downloads correctly
□ Done! ✅

=====================================================
TIME: 2 MINUTES TO FIX
=====================================================

Just upload 1 file. No commands needed this time.
