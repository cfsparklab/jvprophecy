## 📦 Files Modified (3 Files)

### 1. `app/Http/Controllers/PublicController.php`

**Method:** `downloadUploadedProphecyPdf()`

**What it does now:**
1. Checks if user is logged in (shows friendly error if not)
2. Finds the uploaded PDF file based on language
3. Returns 404 if PDF doesn't exist
4. Increments download counter
5. Logs the download
6. **Directly serves the file** using `response()->file()` - NO manipulation!

### 2. `resources/views/public/prophecy-detail.blade.php`

**Removed:**
- Complex fetch/blob JavaScript
- Mobile detection code
- Loading spinners

**Now:**
- Simple `<a>` tag link
- Browser handles download natively
- Works on all devices

### 3. `resources/views/errors/pdf-not-found.blade.php` (NEW)

**Purpose:**
- Friendly error page when PDF doesn't exist for selected language

## 🚀 How It Works Now

```
User clicks "Download PDF"
    ↓
Laravel checks: Is user logged in?
    ↓ Yes
Laravel finds: Does PDF file exist?
    ↓ Yes
Laravel: response()->file($pdfPath)
    ↓
Browser downloads file directly
    ↓
✅ Done!

**Simple. Clean. Reliable.**
